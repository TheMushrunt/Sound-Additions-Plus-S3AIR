## Sound Additions Plus is a mod created by leanycat/LeaningLean and TheMushrunt.

Ever felt like Sonic 3 & Knuckles (and to a further extent, [Sonic 3 A.I.R.](https://sonic3air.org)) was a bit...*lacking* with its usage of sounds? Well, you wouldn't be the first to think that!

The original [Sound Additions](https://gamebanana.com/mods/406112) initially set out to fix this issue, and while it's kept people satisfied, it's about time it got the overhaul it needed.

# Changes from previous versions

- Although a lot of the Sound Additions options were retained, a few got shaved off (mainly sounds used in Sonic Jam), however to make up for it, some additional sounds got lumped into the "Hydrocity Pipes Sound" option and became a "Sonic Mania sounds" option. This includes a corrected "Chaos Emerald Collect" sound heard in the mobile ports of Sonic 1 and 2, to match Origins and Mania.

- Many sounds that Sound Additions previously not replicated from Origins have now been included to the best of our ability. Some are still missing and it's hard to correct that.

- Proper and full [Origins Parity Galore](https://sonic3air.boards.net/thread/316/new-update-origins-parity-galore) support has been added (this is why we changed the mod name, to ensure nothing was muted on both sides of the mods)

- Quite a number of completely new instances of sounds in use were added under the "New music & sounds" option, it'll help make your game even more lively! (We can't possibly list them all, it'd ruin the fun of finding out!)

- Some of the music options were replaced. Some of them were for the greater good, trust us.

- A new option was created for the Competition Mode's Results screen to use different music, bringing it up to the standard of the rest of the miscellaneous menus Sound Additions touches.

- Numerous bugs were fixed and various scripts were improved and/or overhauled completely to ensure that most mods *cannot* mess it up. (Nothing's guaranteed though. Support for mods may be given at times but don't expect everything to be done.)

If anyone is looking to help the mod, doing so in **Pull Requests** or **Issues** would help greatly.
We hope you enjoy the mod!
